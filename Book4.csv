Based on R&D's comment: 

""Current Q4's quailty is worse than Q2.
Since the game developer doesn't know any information about Q4, the game works with its default resolution.
Once we provide the game developer with real device, they will apply higer quality on Q4 after some test.""

Issue should be checked and if required to report game developer once devices in market.
Reporting issue under Q2/B2 will not improve quality for Q4/B4 devices.

1) in case of bad interleaving contents,  it need to re-connect when seek operatio is requested(Range request)
because ot this, it takes too much time to complete seek operation.
this makes user experience too bad to make many VOC

2) in case of RTSP streaming, when seek operation is requested, SEEK command sends to server.
therefore it can takes some times to complete seek operation
and when user use FF/REW, seek operation can be send to server every some milli seconds
